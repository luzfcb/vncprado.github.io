title: No so simple ROS Solution
---

In our lab there is a robot in which we've been working a lot since the beginig of the year.
I'll ewxplain a little bit about it and show our implementations in some post in the future.

Now I just want to talk about our standalone computer solution: [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/
) + [Ubuntu](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ARM/RaspberryPi) + [ROS](http://wiki.ros.org/indigo/Installation/UbuntuARM) both for ARM.
Quite simple, right? Not really.

I first tried to install in a raspberry pi A+ but its small RAM and limitations pers√© deservers a post.
