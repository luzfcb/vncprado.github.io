Here will go the dynamixel installation from github to solve joint_trajectory_action errors

For some reason my dynamixel installation for ROS Indigo give me some errors when I try to use the joint trajectory action so I perform an installation from the [github repo](https://github.com/arebgun/dynamixel_motor)

Create catkin workspace for it and install (explain how to install on /opt)
