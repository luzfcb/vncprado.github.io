In my adventures trying to print with NinjaFlex I almost "bricked" our 3D printer. It is a Makerbot Replicator 2X and after some firmware update --- through the software provided --- it starts to think it was a Replicator 2. I don't know the difference between them but it just didn't seem right ---  I know that Replicator 2 has a slightly larger plate.

How the official software allow you to update wrong firmware? As crazy as it sounds, the official support does know about this issue and say that I need to reinstall the correct firmware. But after searching really much I didn't find any clear way to do this --- in some of the tutorials they tell you to click a button that doesn't exist in the software they provide.

Searching online I found some Windows software that claims could update the firmware but most cases It didn't and in one case our printer went off with only the stop buttons light on.

I finally found [this](http://www.sailfishfirmware.com/doc/install.html) firmware where you can go directly to [removing](http://www.sailfishfirmware.com/doc/install-removing.html) and follow their instructions after downloading the software.

Keep in mind that they use a website provided by MakerBot company which seems to me that is keeping these old printers with a lot less support than its suppose.

All the best!
