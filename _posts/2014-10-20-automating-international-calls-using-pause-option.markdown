Trying to make cheaper calls to my family in Brazil using a international card, I found out that I need to dial 21 numbers before my parent's number every call. So I looked for a way to store all that stuff in my phonebook.

The system works like these:

* You call to a local number (10 digits).
* Select the language for instructions (1 digit).
* Dial a PIN number printed in the card you bought (12 digits!).
* They tell the card's balance.
* Finally you dial 5 digits (011 55 for Brazil) followed by the desired number (10-11 digits).

Then I found that you can use a pause option to store a whole ramal number that you dial frequently. It is useful when you call an automated system that asks for a ramal. The option makes your cellphone wait a second and dial by itself the desired ramal. This way I could put all this numbers in an entry and simply call like an unique number.

In my phone comma is the symbol for this pause.
Finally the whole number is stored like this:
	
    access #, option, PIN, country digit + # 
	613 216 0780,1,xxx xxx xxx xxx,011 55 xx xxxx xxxx
    
So I can make calls to Brazil directly from my phonebook. There is only one issue that I need to change the PIN in all stored numbers when money runs out in my current card =/

That's all.
