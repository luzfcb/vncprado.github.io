Recently I bought a Chromebook (Acer C720). I think that Chrome OS powered computers will be a real turning point to average user. They are really simple and almost all, cheap machines. If you have all your every day work online, you barely realize that you are using a browser-focused linux distribution. Resisting to make any modifications or put a Linux distribution, I've been trying to use the computer as it came.

Almost every computer-based tasks can be done online. Editing documents and spreadsheets on Google docs or Microsoft Office 365. Reading emails, long ago, is a task done in the browser. Even for LaTeX compositions, I've been using [ShareLaTeX](https://www.sharelatex.com/project). But the problem arise when development comes to conversation.

It is really hard to imagine doing real coding in a browser. But there is already lots of solutions for (mainly) web development. Between them Cloud9 and Codiad.

Since both are open source, instead of using their online plan I installed they in this server that hosts my blog and other stuff.

In the following links I comment and explain how to install both: [Codiad](http://blog.viniciusprado.org/how-to-install-and-configure-codiad-in-your-own-server) and [Cloud9](http://blog.viniciusprado.org/how-to-install-and-configure-cloud9-in-your-own-server)
