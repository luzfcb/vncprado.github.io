I've been using a C720 Chromebook for a while now and instead of complaining about limitations I tried to keep an open mind for this new "type" of computer (actually only a simpler OS). When talking about limitations I mean that all you have (with some exception) is your browser.

So I made a small list (probably getting bigger in next months)

+ **Text** a helpful and honest text editor with syntax highlight and other really good features. I miss [atom](https://atom.io/) on my Ubuntu machine but It is better than other editors I tried.

+ **Bitford** To get some stuff from torrent I use this app. It still seems like unfinished (or beta?) but surprisingly comes with an embedded Player (someone said PopcornTime?). I prefer to use Chrome OS player because fullscreen was not working on Bitford. Still in time: I needed to use http://magnet2torrent.me/ because I only found Better Call Saul magnet links ;) I don't know if it is the best for this service but solved my problem.

+ **Coding** One problem that advanced users would face is how to coding in a Chromebook. You can use many services online to solve this problem, and all of them are really good. but I prefer to have my own environment. I knew that [Cloud9](c9.io) is open source, but the version that they had on GitHub was old. Hopefully, they put a new version available that I could use. Actually I made [this](http://blog.viniciusprado.org/how-to-install-and-configure-cloud9-in-your-own-server/) tutorial on how to install Cloud9 on your server. So from your Chromebook (actually from any computer) you can program like on a Ubuntu machine.  

+ **Dropbox** After a while thinking to migrate to Google drive or make some IFTTT synchronization or try extensions and a lot of bad stuff I found out that apps would be able to use the Chomebook's file system. Sometime after that I found out this, they made [this](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/file-system-for-dropbox/hlffpaajmfllggclnjppbblobdhokjhe?utm_source=chrome-app-launcher-info-dialog) extension to access your Dropbox from you Chromebook \o/ 

I tried to focus on native apps, but you have all online app to use, it is a browser focused OS =)

That's All.
